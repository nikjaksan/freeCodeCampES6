# freeCodeCampES6

A repository containing fCC's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms: ES6 course

Includes my own attempts, notes and extras from completing the JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms ES6 course.

The course is quite challenging and I would recommend checking it out at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6
